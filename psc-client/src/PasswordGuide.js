              <h3>How to Create Strong Passwords</h3>
              <p>Follow these steps to create a strong password:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Determine the Length of Your Password. Aim for at least 12 characters.</li>
                <li>Mix Different Types of Characters. Include uppercase letters (A-Z), lowercase letters (a-z), numbers (0-9), and special characters (@, #, $, %, etc.).</li>
                <li>Avoid Using Easily Guessable Information like names, birthdates, or common words.</li>
                <li>Create a Passphrase or Use Random Words.</li>
                <li>Incorporate Non-Obvious Patterns.</li>
                <li>Avoid Common Substitutions like replacing "a" with "@" or "o" with "0".</li>
                <li>Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) wherever possible.</li>
                <li>Test the Strength of Your Password by using reputable tools or password managers to check the strength of your password.</li>
                <li>Store Your Password Securely by using a secure password manager rather than writing them down or saving them in an unsecured digital file.</li>
